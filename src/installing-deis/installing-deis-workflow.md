# Installing Deis Workflow

We will use the `helm` utility to install Deis Workflow onto a Kubernetes cluster. If you don't
have `helm` installed, see [installing helm][helm] for more info.

## Check Your Setup

First check that you have `helm` installed and the version is correct.

```
$ helm --version
0.4.0
```

Ensure your kubectl client is installed and ensure it can connect to your Kubernetes cluster. This
is where `helm` will attempt to communicate with the cluster. You can test that it is working
properly by running:

```
$ helm target
Kubernetes master is running at https://10.245.1.2
Heapster is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster
KubeDNS is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns
KubeUI is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-ui
Grafana is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana
InfluxDB is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-influxdb
```

If you see a list of targets like the one above, 'helm' can communicate with the kubernetes master.

## Add the Deis Chart Repository

The [Deis Chart Repository](https://github.com/deis/charts) contains everything you
need to install Deis onto your Kubernetes cluster, with a single `helm install` command.

Run the following command to add this repository to Helm:

```
$ helm repo add deis https://github.com/deis/charts
```

## Install Deis Workflow

Now that you have Helm installed and have added the Deis Chart Repository, install Workflow by running:

```
$ helm fetch deis/deis                 # fetches the chart into a local workspace
$ helm generate -x manifests deis      # generates various secrets
$ helm install deis                    # injects resources into your cluster
```

Helm will install a variety of Kubernetes resources in the `deis` namespace.
You'll need to wait for the pods that it launched to be ready. Monitor their status
by running:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=deis
```

If you would like `kubectl` to automatically update as the pod states change, run (type Ctrl-C to stop the watch):
```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=deis -w
```

Once you see all of the pods in the `READY` state, Deis Workflow is up and running!

Next, [configure dns][] so you can register your first user.

[helm]: http://helm.sh

[configure dns]: ../managing-deis/configuring-dns.md
