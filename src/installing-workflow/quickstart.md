# Quick Start

These steps will help you install and configure Deis Workflow on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Check System Requirements

Please refer to the [system requirements][] for considerations when planning your Kubernetes environment.

## Choose a Provider

Choose one of the providers on the [Getting Started Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides)
in the official Kubernetes documentation for a more extensive (but still non-exhaustive) list of
Kubernetes provisioning options supported by the project or the community.

## Install Deis Workflow

Now that you've finished provisioning a cluster, please [Install Deis Workflow][install workflow].

## Configure DNS

See [Configuring DNS][] for more information on properly setting up your DNS records with Deis.

## Register a User

Once your cluster has been provisioned and Deis Workflow has been installed, you can
[install the client][client] and [register your first user][register]!

## Deploy your first Application

Last but not least, select your build process and [deploy your first application][deploy].
