# Deis Roadmap

The Deis Roadmap is a community document created as part of the open [Planning Process][].
Each roadmap item describes a high-level capability or grouping of features
that are deemed important to the future of Deis.

Given the project's rapid [Release Schedule](releases.md), roadmap
items are designed to provide a sense of direction over many releases.

## Deis v2

A complete roadmap for post 2.0 will be provided once we are closer to release.

Much of the Deis team's efforts are focused on Deis v2, which will see the Deis
platform running on Kubernetes.

For details on Deis v2, see the [Deis v2 Design Document][].
