# Contributor Overview

Interested in contributing to a Deis project?  There are lots of ways to help.

## File Bugs & Enhancements

Find a bug? Want to see a new feature? Have a request for the maintainers? Open a Github issue in the applicable repository and we’ll get the conversation started.

## Write Documentation

We are always looking to improve and expand our documentation. Most docs reside in the [deis/workflow][workflow] repository under the [docs/][docs] directory. Simply fork the project, update docs and send us a pull request.

## Contribute Code

We are always looking for help improving the core platform, other workloads, tooling, and test coverage. Interested in contributing code? Let’s chat in IRC. Make sure to check out issues tagged [easy-fix][].

When you're ready to begin writing code, review [Design Documents][dd] and get your [Development Environment][dev-environment] set up.

## Triage Issues

If you don't have time to code, consider helping with triage. The community will thank you for saving them time by spending some of yours. See [Triaging Issues](triaging-issues.md) for more info.

## Share your Experience

Interact with the community on our user mailing list or live in our IRC channel, \#deis on Freenode, where you can chat with other Deis users any time of day.
