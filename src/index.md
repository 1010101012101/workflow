# Welcome to Deis Workflow

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer
to any Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

Deis Workflow includes capabilities for building and deploying from source via `git push`, simple application
configuration, creating and rolling back releases, managing domain names and SSL certificates, providing seamless edge
routing, aggregating logs, and sharing applications with teams. All of this is exposed through a simple REST API and
command line interface.
