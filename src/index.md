# Welcome to Deis Workflow

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer
to any Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

Deis Workflow includes capabilities for building and deploying from source via `git push`, configuring your applications,
creating and rolling back releases, managing application domain names and SSL certificates, providing edge routing,
aggregating application logs, and controlling access to application resources. All of this is exposed through a simple
REST API and command line interface.
