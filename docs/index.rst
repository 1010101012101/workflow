Welcome

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy
:ref:`LXC Containers <container>` and :ref:`Chef Nodes <node>` used to host applications,
databases, middleware and other services. Deis leverages Chef, Docker and
Heroku Buildpacks to provide a private PaaS that is lightweight and flexible.
