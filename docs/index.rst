What is Deis?
-------------

``deis`` is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy
:ref:`container_def`\s and  :ref:`node_def`\s used to host applications,
databases, middleware and other services. Deis leverages Chef, Docker and
Heroku Buildpacks to provide a private PaaS that is lightweight and flexible.

Deis comes with out-of-the-box support for Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java,
Clojure, Scala, Play, PHP, Perl, Dart and Go. However, Deis can deploy
*anything* using Heroku Buildpacks, Docker images, or Chef recipes. Deis is
designed to work with any cloud provider, although only EC2 is currently
supported.
