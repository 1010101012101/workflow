Welcome

Deis is a Django/Celery API server, Python CLI and set of
`Chef cookbooks`_ that combine to provide a Heroku-inspired application
platform for public and private clouds. Your PaaS. Your Rules.

If you are new to Deis, you should start with :ref:`Concepts`.
Once you've completed :ref:`installation` of your private Deis controller,
you should explore :ref:`usage` of the command-line client
which is elaborated on in the :ref:`tutorial`.

Want to learn about Deis internals?  You'll find complete API documentation
in the :ref:`client` and :ref:`server` sections.
