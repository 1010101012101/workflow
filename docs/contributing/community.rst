Community
=========


Conduct
=======

The deis community welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome
you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact
constructively with our community.

While much of the work for our project is technical in nature, we value and
encourage contributions from those with expertise in other areas, and welcome
them into our community.
