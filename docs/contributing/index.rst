Contributing
============

How Can I Help?
---------------

File Bugs & Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Find a bug? Want to see a new feature? Have a request
for the maintainers? Open a GitHub issue and we’ll get the conversation
started.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are always looking to improve and expand our
documentation. Most docs reside in the main repository under the docs/
directory. Simply fork the project, update docs and send us a pull request.

Enhance Chef Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want Chef users to feel at home using Deis. Got an
idea for improving our Chef integration? Have some thoughts on making the
deis-cookbook more reusable? Open a GitHub issue and let us know!

Add New Cloud Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Want to see Deis extended to a new cloud provider? Go
for it! Adding new providers is easy. Just follow the EC2 example and make
sure you provide test coverage in your pull request.

Improve Deis Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deis core is a Django/Celery application with a Python CLI.
We are always looking for help improving the core framework, tooling and test
coverage. Interested in contributing to Deis core? Let’s chat in IRC.
