:description: The open source planning process for the Deis project used to define the roadmap and its execution.

.. _planning:

Planning Process
================
Deis features a lightweight process that emphasizes openness and ensures every community member can be an integral part of planning for the future.

The Role of Maintainers
-----------------------
Maintainers lead the project. Their duties include proposing the Roadmap, reviewing and integrating contributions and maintaining the vision of the project.

Open Roadmap
------------
The :ref:`roadmap` is a community document. While Maintainers propose the Roadmap, it gets discussed and refined in Sprint Meetings.

Contributing to the Roadmap
---------------------------
Proposals and issues can be opened by anyone. Every member of the :ref:`community` is welcome to participate in the discussion by providing feedback and/or offering counter-proposals.

Release Milestones
------------------
The Roadmap gets delivered progressively via the :ref:`release_schedule`.  Releases are defined during Sprint Meetings and managed using GitHub Milestones which track specific deliverables and work-in-progress.

Sprint Meetings
---------------
Major decisions affecting the Roadmap are discussed during Sprint Meetings on the first Thursday of each month, aligned with the :ref:`release_schedule`.

Sprint meetings are open to the public with access coordinated via the #deis IRC channel on Freenode.
