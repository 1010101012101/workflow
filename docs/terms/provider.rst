Provider
========
A provider is a pluggable connector to a third-party cloud API, such as `Amazon EC2`_.
Deis's supported providers come pre-installed on the :ref:`Controller`.

Building a custom provider is simple.  It must publish 5 methods as Celery tasks:

* build_layer - to create any shared infrastructure needed by the layer's nodes
* destroy_layer - to destroy any shared infrastructure
* launch_node - to provision a node and register it with the Chef Server
* terminate_node - to destroy a node a remove its records from the Chef Server
* converge_node - to force converge a node (using SSH or other means)

Provider developers can review the `EC2 Reference Implementation`_.
