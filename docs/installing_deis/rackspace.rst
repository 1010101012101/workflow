Rackspace
=========

We'll mostly be following the `CoreOS on Rackspace`_ guide. You'll need to have a sane python
environment with ``pip`` already installed (``sudo easy_install pip``). Please refer to the scripts
in `contrib/rackspace`_ while following this documentation.


Install supernova
-----------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pip install keyring
    $ sudo pip install rackspace-novaclient
    $ sudo pip install supernova


Configure supernova
-------------------

Edit ``~/.supernova`` to match the following:

.. code-block:: console

    [production]
    OS_AUTH_URL = https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/
    OS_USERNAME = {rackspace_username}
    OS_PASSWORD = {rackspace_api_key}
    OS_TENANT_NAME = {rackspace_account_id}
    OS_REGION_NAME = DFW (or ORD or another region)
    OS_AUTH_SYSTEM = rackspace

Your account ID is displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the cloud control panel UI, and your
API key can be found on the Account Settings page.


Set up your keys
----------------

Choose an existing keypair or generate a new one, if desired. Tell supernova about the key pair and
give it an identifiable name:

.. code-block:: console

    $ supernova production keypair-add --pub-key ~/.ssh/deis.pub deis-key


Generate a New Discovery URL
----------------------------

To get started with provisioning the nodes, we will need to generate a new Discovery URL.
Discovery URLs help connect `etcd`_ instances together by storing a list of peer addresses and
metadata under a unique address. You can generate a new discovery URL for use in your platform by
running the following from the root of the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make discovery-url


### Choose number of instances
By default, the provision script will provision 3 servers. You can override this by setting `DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES`:
```console
$ DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES=5 ./provision-rackspace-cluster.sh deis-key
```

Note that for scheduling to work properly, clusters must consist of at least 3 nodes and always have an odd number of members.
For more information, see [optimal etcd cluster size](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/optimal-cluster-size.md).

Deis clusters of less than 3 nodes are unsupported.


Run the Provision Script
------------------------

Run the Rackspace provision script to spawn a new CoreOS cluster. You'll need to provide the name
of the key pair you just added. Optionally, you can also specify a flavor name.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd contrib/rackspace
    $ ./provision-rackspace-cluster.sh
    Usage: provision-rackspace-cluster.sh <key pair name> [flavor]
    $ ./provision-rackspace-cluster.sh deis-key


Configure DNS
-------------

See :ref:`configure-dns` for more information on properly setting up your DNS records with Deis.


Install Deis Platform
---------------------

Now that you've finished provisioning a cluster, please refer to :ref:`install_deis_platform` to
start installing the platform.
