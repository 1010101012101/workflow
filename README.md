Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes][k8s-home] cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

## Beta Status

Many Deis components are currently in beta status, as are these docs, and we welcome your input! If you have feedback, please [submit an issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and [submit a pull request][prs].

# Development

The Deis project welcomes contributions from all developers. The high level process for development matches many other open source projects. See below for an outline.

* Fork this repository
* Make your changes
* [Submit a pull request][prs] (PR) to this repository with your changes, and unit tests whenever possible
	* If your PR fixes any [issues][issues], make sure you write `Fixes #1234` in your PR description (where `#1234` is the number of the issue you're closing)
* The Deis core contributors will review your code. After each of them sign off on your code, they'll label your PR with `LGTM1` and `LGTM2` (respectively). Once that happens, a contributor will merge it
